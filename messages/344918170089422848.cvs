da fuk,you guys need to fix your ears,it's 4 notes,you can even here the melody in thebackground following it,pythius's reese isn't one note,ooohh.,yeah i know the type,super easy bass,that bass isn't complicated. it's the elements around it which make that track so cool,yuh,i could if i tried most likely,just sounds like a distorted reese with the mids cut out,it's not overly complicated,at all. the lack of processing is what makes it sound good,I really feel like that snare needs more crispness. It sounds really under the mix in the highs when it should be jumping out,
