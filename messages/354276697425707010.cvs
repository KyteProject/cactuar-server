lol,how long have you been producing for,<@!351675351367417870> youre annoying!,seriously though that rick testing stuff doesnt belong here if im correct,so it cant be tested inside <#237307052911755264>,hahahahaha,you might also need to add something to the start of the drop imo since it doesnt sound that hard hitting atm,I think a kind of small transition into the first kick would already make a huge difference,like a reversed kick,then you can leave the other reverse sound in place,and i find the reese in the intro a bit repetitive,but thats all just my opinion,i would just let it play in the second half of the intro,exactly,
