Might aswell send this in here - why I have been offline for so long  and will be for some more days:
After moving to my new flat the first ISP did tell me some bullshit so they couldn't activate the internet  so I had to switch the provider  the new ISP had a appointement this saturday to activate the internet  but to my disappointement they sent me a letter which said the new time for the appointement with the technician would be the 25th  so I have to wait even longer for my internet to be up and running. I only have a limited amount of mobile data  so I only check Discord if somebody writes a DM regarding the community samplepack. It's really annoying because at this time I wanted to be fully active here and on Soundcloud.,I feel so stupid  I might need some time to get used to the bot stuff,Pardon me if I do some stuff wrong at first :v,
