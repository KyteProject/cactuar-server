Drums can be louder,also mids a bit too muddy for my liking,tough idea is cool ğŸ˜‰,huh,wheres the song? <@290194221539786753>,but I didnt listen :/,1:13 is a bit hars aint it?,Like the original nature of the drop tough,Filter it,and add some more reverb,otherwise Im loving the idea,Variation in drums is on point,Sidechain is a bit obnoxious,other  than that  nice sound design ğŸ˜‰,
