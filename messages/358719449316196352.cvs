<@344918170089422848> are you going to listen to my stuff?,😁,<@344918170089422848> were you talking about my bass?,I bounced out a C and then played a  lower F so I lost a bit of the crunch when I uploaded it on clyp.,The best part is I got a granulariser on it.,Now I can do weird shit on the bass. Yay.,😁,Can you give me a good midi?,I will load it up on the synth and bounce out a new file.,<@344918170089422848>,Maybe I should ask artfx,<@344918170089422848> the highs are caved out for the snare and high hats.,Mid mud has been removed.,And there is some quick detune settings and a weak filter lfo.,
