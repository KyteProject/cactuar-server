Sorry!,Okay gotcha,(:,Yeah I took no offense to it- The real pain is you not giving it a go yet.,Cheers bud!,I fully agree with you on all of those points - especially the sidechain. I think my issue in previous mixes is getting the kick / snare to punch so I've gone full power the opposite way on here and yeah - a little weird.,I think I need to step away from relying on bus / premaster compression to bring the loudness at the end ¬¬,I'm going to have to check that out. Always a learning curve!,That sounds like a good place to investigate next. Thanks <@211835368776007681>! Do you have any links to work you've done?,
