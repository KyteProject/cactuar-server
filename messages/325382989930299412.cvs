<@180316263971553280> to me it sounds too much compressed that it hurts my ears. Maybe you like that sharpness. But I would tone down some compression and keep the natural tone of the brass. Also as others said  the stereo field feels narrwo because of lack of reverb. Use reverb on instruments. On drums  you may use plate reverb to give it a room. 

Rest  nice hard dubstep track,Also tone down the EQ at high end. It sounds shrill,what does that even mean Mr. Bot?? I've twisted more knobs than you can count lol,There you go. You shouldn't overcompress stuff. It takes away all the dynamics of the sound. It may give you a false perception of sharpness and punchiness but that's actually at the cost of some bass and sound quality too. I use least compression to make it sound natural. Use multiband compression to level out the mix and make it sound balanced.,compression is like toxin. It should be used in moderation. 

start production at low volume around -6 db or something. Then boost it with limiter and use compression for balancing the overall mix. Not to crank the shit out of your mix. 

It's like grabbing the neck of your mix and squeezing the life out of it lol,don't forget about multiband compression. There are different types of compression.,Yes I agree mainly subtractive EQ to be specific,on master track,sorry  I am new here haha,
