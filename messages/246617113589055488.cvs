dan tagged (at)here  bc he wanted feedback,29 is still too much imo,honestly  i like the minimal drop after that build up a lot,i like the contrast,i did turn down the higher notes on the sub  because they sounded a little annoying. but i could make the difference less big i guess,i see what you mean,i'll work on the build up a little bit more  but i do want to keep the sound design,
