<@!313728447933448203> I suggest to really study the tracks in the genre  this is a good start although it could use some custom synth sounds and better composition. Perhaps look into the basics of subtractive synthesis and learn how to compose simple chord progressions  this is how I started and it will help you improve dramatically.,<@180316263971553280> This is an awesome idea! I love the little brassy stabs in the drop  although I find that in the drop some of the synths are really wide and some of them are super narrow in the stereo field. They need to be widened a bit  perhaps with some chorus  phasers or flangers. The drums could use a little work  look into using some better samples or look up some tutorials for drum and bass drums  I think this will help you for sure. Layer your snares up and pitch modulate them to make them hella tight and make sure you crank that kick with some compression to help it hit super hard.,You,*You're using some great percussion patterns,Yeah  I second the reverb  use a short decay with a fairly dry setting  it helps the bass sound 'bigger',#limiterlyfe,Compression is actually so hard to get ahold of in all honesty lmao.,I'm still shit at it.,I usually do it on bus tracks for 'glueing' purposes.,and on drums for punch,Yeah  like I guess you probably don't want an atmospheric type sound like a pad to pop out of your mix just because you destroyed all the dynamics.,I still think EQ'ing is the most powerful mixing tool in all honesty.,We should probably move over to <#245256153636929537>,
